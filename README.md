# All Serial Spoofer - HWID Ban Bypass

Welcome to the **All Serial Spoofer**, a tool designed to help you bypass **HWID bans** by spoofing your **hardware serials**, such as:

- **Motherboard serial**
- **CPU serial**
- **GPU serial**
- **Disk serial**
- **Network adapter serial**

This tool works by modifying the identifiers that are tracked by certain games, applications, or services that implement HWID bans. With this spoofer, you can easily change your hardware identifiers, allowing you to bypass the ban and continue playing or using services.

### Step 1: Run the Spoofer as Administrator

1. Right-click on `SerialSpoofer.exe` and select **Run as administrator**.
   
2. The tool will launch, displaying the main window.

### Step 2: Select Hardware to Spoof

1. The spoofer will automatically detect all hardware components that can be spoofed (motherboard, CPU, GPU, etc.).
2. You can select which components to spoof (e.g., CPU, GPU, etc.).

### Step 3: Apply the Spoof

1. Click on the **Spoof Selected** button. 
2. The tool will modify the hardware identifiers, changing them to randomized values.

### Step 4: Restart Your PC

Once the spoofing process is complete, restart your system to apply the changes.

### Step 5: Verify the Change

After rebooting, you can use tools like **HWID Spoofer Checker** to verify that the hardware identifiers have been successfully spoofed.

## Modification Guide

This tool spoofs the following hardware identifiers:

- **Motherboard Serial**  
- **CPU Serial**  
- **GPU Serial**  
- **Disk Serial**  
- **Network Adapter MAC Address**

Each identifier is modified by interacting with the system’s registry and hardware-related files. 

### Motherboard Serial Spoofing

1. Locate the **Motherboard Registry Key** in the system registry:  
   `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\BIOS`
2. Modify the **Motherboard Serial** entry to a randomized value.

### CPU Serial Spoofing

1. Access the **CPUID Instruction** to retrieve and modify the serial number stored in the processor.
2. Modify the entry to a new, randomly generated value.

### GPU Serial Spoofing

1. Modify **GPU hardware IDs** through the device manager or the **NVIDIA/AMD** driver files.

> **Note**:  
> The **modification guide** requires advanced knowledge of system internals and should only be performed if you're familiar with registry and device driver modifications.
